#A series of equations A / B = k can be seen as a graph in which nodes are the dividend and divisor A and B and weights are the result of the division. So we simply create the graph and traverse it with DFS/BFS to get our result.

#Complexity is K * O(N + M) where N and M are the number of nodes and edges, and K is the number of queries. How many nodes can we have? Itâ€™s 2 * E, where E is the number of equations (2 different nodes per each equation). We can have at most E edges in the graph.

#So total complexity is O(K * E), with O(E) additional space for the graph.
